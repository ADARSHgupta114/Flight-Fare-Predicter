# Flight-Fare-Predictor :airplane:
  In this Project or Machine Learning Model we have tried to find the answers for the following Questions.
####  1. When is the best time to book flights?
> For each flight and airline price patterns are different. Generally the earlier you buy plane tickets, the higher probability there is to get the cheapest deal. However we found that is not always true, especially for low-cost airlines and also depends on when you fly. AirHint flight price predictor tracks and takes into account price fluctuations per airline, region and route to recommend you the best moment to book.
#### 2. What is the best day to book flights ?
> We did research on this and found that indeed there is a trend which day of the week/month is the best, but it varies per airline. 
#### 3.Why is our Model unique?
>Because our airfare predictions were designed to check the price patterns of one airline at a time and this can only mean an increased accuracy prediction. While the other price comparison websites base their predictions on a general one-size-fits-all model, we customize our tool depending on the airline's flight price patterns. The number of flights may be a bit more limited, but this is a small price to pay for the high accuracy of predictions.
#### 4. Why do airlines change prices so often?
>This is a great question. Airlines change ticket prices frequently depending on several factors, such as the flight's popularity, the season, school holidays, special events and above all, the balance between supply and demand of seats. Budget airlines usually start with default higher price and adjust airfares depending on current demand. AirHint wants to be one step ahead of these changes! Our team is dedicated to find ticket price patterns and predict price changes for many airlines around the world.
